This source code archive contains code for Enterprise, a custom UEFI bootloader designed to load Linux distributions directly from ISO files on Apple Mac computers (even those without UEFI booting support). It is designed to compliment [Mac Linux USB Loader](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader), though it can also be used separately (albeit with some setup work). The purpose of Enterprise is as the first stage in a two-stage booting process for Mac Linux USB Loader-created USB drives. Essentially, Enterprise loads GRUB, giving it configuration settings and the location of necessary files inside of the ISO, and then the distribution is booted.

Now, with that out the way (phew!), let's get to the interesting stuff, shall we?

### LICENSE ###

Enterprise is under the LGPL. Enterprise is not *only* my program; it pulls in code from other software projects (namely, gummiboot), and I want to make sure that not only they get credit from their work, but that others can benefit from what I've done as well. Releasing Enterprise under the LGPL allows me to most easily do this.

### CODING STYLE ###

I've decided to establish, up front, a coding style for Enterprise for anyone that wants to contribute. Most important: braces and if-statements. I'll sum up my policy in one code block:

    if (true)
        bob();
    else
        sam();

is _not_ complaint. This is how I prefer it:

    if (true) {
        bob();
    } else {
        sam();
    }

For those of you in the know, I code using a style called [1TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS "One True Brace Style") - or, the "one true brace style". I quite like it. So much so, in fact, that it's the required syntax style (just so things don't get messy).

Same goes with functions, other blocks like `while`, `do`, and pretty much anything else. Please realize that not everything will be under this style (particularly code I've pulled in from elsewhere), but I'll do my best to follow this style, and if you contribute, I expect you to do yours.

Secondly, all source code files must use *tabs* - not spaces, and I expect a tab width of 4. If your editor is configured to use spaces, you *must* convert the spaces into tabs with a width of 4. This can be done with a UNIX command like `unexpand --tabs=4`.

### PULL REQUESTS ###

I will accept pull requests on two conditions:

1. Your code follows my coding styles (mentioned above) and
2. Your code is licensed under an LGPL-compatible license and is readable and decently commented.

Assuming that your code is in compliance with these rules, I usually will accept pull requests that either: add a feature/fix a bug that is listed via the checkboxes above or fix an issue filed through GitHub.

### FINAL THOUGHTS ###

That's about it, I think. Hope this helps someone.
